# Things I've learnt

To create a project with meteor run:

```
meteor create {{project_name}}
```

This will create the following files

```
/client
  main.css
  main.html
  main.js
/server
  main.js
.gitignore
package.json
```

The front-end files are placed into the client folder and the backend is inside the server folder.
